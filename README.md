<h3>Welcome aboard TkSmash universe !</h3>
<h4>Whats is TkSmash ?</h4>
<p>TkSmash is a simple 2D game that allows you and one of your friend to fight on the same machine. Each character can hit the other one, and inflict a certain amount of damages. If you want to defeat your opponent, you will have to beat him 3 times.</p>
<h4>How do I play TkSmash ?</h4>
<p>The two players fight on one keyboard :</p>
<ul>
<li>The first player uses "Q" (left), "D" (right), "Z" (jump) and "Space" (hit)</li>
<li>The second player uses the left, right and top directional arrows to move plus the "P" key to hit</li>
</ul>
<h4>What is TkSmash made of ?</h4>
<p>Other than several headaches, TkSmash is based on Python graphical interface Tkinter. At this time, no other programming language is used. We use the last Python 3.x versions.</p>
<h4>Who is involved in this project ?</h4>
<p>Four collaborators have made this project, which will be graded as it is part of an exam. Among those collaborators are :</p>
<ul>
<li>Yamazarashi -> GitHub : https://github.com/Yamazarashi</li>
<li>Numcaps     -> GitHub : https://github.com/Numcaps</li>
<li>MrNatsu</li>
<li>Myself      -> GitHub : https://github.com/Lumiox</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is this project going to evolve ?</h4>
<p>As it depends on those collaborators, this project may evolve in the future. We will keep you informed if we intend to do so.</p>
<h4>How can I be part of the project ?</h4>
<p>If you are familiar with the GitHub world and community, the answer is obvious : if you propose modifications, if you add and therefore improve this content, we will be really glad to add and specify your contribution to this project.</p>
<h4>What should I know about this project ?</h4>
<p>This project is part of a project that will be marked by teachers qualified in the computer science and programming fields. This note will count for the French "baccalaur√©at", and is therefore <em>coded and commented in French</em>. However, if you express your interest in an English translation, we can translate the whole project once it has been graded : the project will be open to such translation starting from July.</p>
<p><strong>Note :</strong> as a first in collaborative programming, we have kept this project basic, and are aware of the strong parts that should be improved and / or optimized</p>
